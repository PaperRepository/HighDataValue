Abstract: Natural disasters often severely damage communication infrastructure, making timely situational awareness a critical challenge for distributed emergency response. UAV-assisted digital twin systems offer a promising solution by collecting data from distributed sensing devices and synchronizing the disaster environment in the virtual domain. However, existing studies typically overlook the exponential decay of data value following disasters and tend to fully collect low-value data, which degrades DT synchronization and results in the loss of critical disaster information. In this paper, we propose a value-aware data collection and synchronization framework for UAV-assisted DT systems in post-disaster scenarios. By jointly considering spatial consistency and DT update ratio, we formulate a data value maximization problem. The original problem is decomposed, and an efficient iterative algorithm with low time complexity is developed to explore the feasible solution space and progressively improve the solution quality. The convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are established through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations. Simulation results based on real disaster datasets demonstrate that the accumulative data value is up to 15.8% higher than that of existing studies.
